Description: Generate your Rd documentation, 'NAMESPACE' file,
    and collation field using specially formatted comments. Writing
    documentation in-line with code makes it easier to keep your
    documentation up-to-date as your requirements change. 'Roxygen2' is
    inspired by the 'Doxygen' system for C++.
