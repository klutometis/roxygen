# roxygen2 4.0.0

Roxygen2 4.0.0 is a major update to roxygen2 that makes provides enhanced error handling and considerably safer default behaviour. Now, roxygen2 will never overwrite a file that it did not create. This means that before you run it for the first time, you'll need to run `roxygen2::upgradeRoxygen()`. That will flag all existing files as being created by roxygen2.

## New features

* Six vignettes provide a comprehensive overview of using roxygen2 in
  practice. Run `browseVignettes("roxygen2")` to access.

* `@describeIn` makes it easier to describe multiple function in
  one file. This is especially useful if you want to document methods with
  their generic, or with a common class, but it's also useful if you want
  to document multiple related functions in one file (#185).

* `@field` documents the fields on a reference class (#181). It works the
  same way as `@slot` for S4 classes.

* Roxygen2 now adds a comment to all generated files so that you know
  they've been generated, and should not be hand edited.

* Roxygen2 no longer wraps the text in Rd files by default, i.e. the default
  option is `wrap = FALSE` now. To override it, you have to specify a field
  `Roxygen: list(wrap = TRUE)` in `DESCRIPTION` (#178).

## Improved error handling

* Roxygen2 will never overwrite a file that was not generated by
  roxygen2. This means that the first time you use this version of
  roxygen, you'll need to delete all existing Rd files. `roxygenise()`
  gains a clean argument that will automatically remove any files
  previously created by roxygen2.

* Parsing is stricter: many issues that were previously warnings are
  now errors. All errors should now give you the line number of the
  roxygen block associated with the error.

* Every input is now checked to make sure that you have matching braces
  (e.g. every `{` has a matching `}`). This should prevent frustrating
  errors that require careful reading of `.Rd` files (#183).

* `@section` titles and `@export` tags can now only span a single line
  to prevent common bugs.

* `@S3method` is deprecated - just use `@export` (#198).

* Namespace tags now throw parsing errors if you give them bad inputs (#220).

* Better error message if you try to document something other than NULL,
  an assignment, a class, a generic or a method (#194).

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Remove unneeded codetools and tools dependencies.

* Bump required Rcpp version to 0.11.0, and remove custom makefiles.

* Non-syntactic argument names (like `_x`) are now surrounded by back-ticks
  in the usage (#191).

* The internal parsers are no longer part of the public roxygen2 interface.

* Usage statements in generated roxygen statements non-longer contain
  non-ASCII characters and will be wrapped if long (#180).

* By default, reference classes now only document their own methods,
  not their methods of parents (#201).

* Default aliases always include the original name of the object, even if
  overridden by `@name`. This also means that `A <- setClass("A")` will get
  two aliases by default: `A` and `A-class` (#202). Use `@aliases NULL` to
  suppress default alias.

* Non-syntactic class names (like `<-`) are now escaped in the usage
  section of S4 methods (#205).

* Eliminated two more cases where wrapping occured even when `wrap = FALSE`.

# roxygen2 3.1.0

## Documentation for reference classes

It's now possible to document reference classes, using the "docstring"
convention described in `?setRefClass`. If you want to provide a short
paragraph description of what a method does, make the first component of the
message a string containing the description, e.g.:

```R
setRefClass("A", methods = list(
  f = function(a, b) {
    "Take numbers \code{a} and \code{b} and add them together"
    a + b
  }
))
```

Unlike the documentation for R functions, the documentation for methods can
be quite succinct.

Roxygen adopts the convention that documented methods are public, and will
be listed in the man page for the object. Undocumented methods are private and
will not be shown in the documentation. The methods for all superclasses are
also listed, so that you don't need to flip through multiple pages of
documentation to understand what you can do with an object. All documented
methods will be placed in a bulleted list in a section titled "Methods", the
method usage will be automatically prepended to the docstring.

## Minor fixes and improvements

* Fixes for Rcpp 0.11.0 compatibility.

* `roxygenise()` now invisible returns a list of all files generated
  by individual roclets. This is useful for tools that want to figure
  out if there are extra files in the `man/` directory.

* `is_s3_generic()` now recognises group generics (#166).

* Don't try and add parameters for data objects (#165).

* Sort output of families using C locale (#171).

* `@family` now escapes function names in references (#172).

# roxygen2 3.0.0

Roxygen2 now fully supports S4 and RC (reference classes) - you should no
longer need to manually add `@alias` or `@usage` tags for S4 classes, methods
and generics, or for RC classes.

* The default usage definitions are much better, generating the correct
  usage for data sets (#122), S3 methods (without additional `@method` tag),
  S4 generics, S4 methods, and for replacement (#119) and infix functions.
  Backslashes in function arguments in are correctly escaped. Usage statements
  also use a more sophisticated line wrapping algorithm so that they should
  cause fewer problems with the R CMD check line limit. (#89, #125).

* S4 classes, S4 methods, and RC classes are given better default topics,
  and the file names corresponding to those topics are shorter.

* S4 methods will automatically inherit parameter documentation from their
  generic.

* `@slot name description` allows you to document the slots of a S4 class.

S3 support has also been improved: roxygen2 now figures out whether a function
is a S3 method or generic. (In the rare cases it does so incorrectly, use
`@method` to manually describe the generic and class associated with a method). This means you can remove existing uses of `@method`, and can replace
`@S3method` with `@export`.

Roxygen now has support for package specific options through the `Roxygen`
field in the `DESCRIPTION`. The value of the field should be R code that
results in a list. Currently only `wrap` and `roclet` values are supported:

* Turn off Rd re-wrapping with adding `Roxygen: list(wrap = FALSE)`

* Change the default roclets by specifying
  `Roxygen: list(roclets = c("collate", "rd"))`

Roxygen 3.0 also includes a number of minor fixes and improvements:

* Infix functions are now escaped correctly in the `NAMESPACE`. (Thanks to
  @crowding, #111)

* `roxygenise()` now works more like `devtools::document()` and only ever works
  in the current directory. The arguments `roxygen.dir`, `overwrite`,
  `copy.package` and `unlink.target` have been deprecated due to potential
  data loss problems.

* The collate roclet is no longer a roclet: it processes R files using custom
  code (only statically, not dynamically) and is designed to be executed before
  the code is sourced.  Run `update_collate()` to update the Collate directive
  based on `@include` tags - if there are none present, a collate directive
  will not be generated.

* `@useDynLib` now works with more possible specifications - if you include a
  comma in the tag value, the output will be passed as is. This means that
  `@useDynLib mypackage, .registration = TRUE` will now generate
  `useDynLib(mypackage, .registration = TRUE)` in the NAMESPACE. (#124)

* `inst` directory not created by default (#56).

* Explicitly depend on `utils` and `methods` packages to make roxygen
  compatible with `Rscript` (#72). Import `digest` package instead of
  depending on it.

* Always use C locale when sorting `NAMESPACE` file or tags in `.Rd` files.
  This ensures a consistent ordering across systems (#127).

* Templates with extension `.r` are supported on case-sensitive file systems
  (#115). Template variables now actually work (#160, thanks to @bronaugh).

* Suppress default aliases, format and usage with `@aliases NULL`,
  `@format NULL` and `@usage NULL`.

# roxygen2 2.2.2

* Correctly use keyword `datasets` not `dataset` (Fixes #60)

* Reference classes no longer given incorrect docType (data).

# roxygen2 2.2.1

* Use unicode escapes in test files so tests pass on all platforms.

* Work around bug in `gsub` in C locale by manually specifying `Encoding()`.

# roxygen2 2.2

## New features

* Package docType will automatically add package alias, if needed. (Fixes #4)

* Data docType will automatically add `datasets` keyword, default usage, and
  default format. (Fixes #5). Data docType automatically added to data
  objects.

* New `@encoding` tag for manually setting non-ASCII encodings when needed.
  (Fixes #7)

## Bug fixes

* `write.description()` now tries much harder to respect
  users' original DESCRIPTION field formatting instead of forcibly
  re-wrapping certain fields at 60 characters.

* `@details` and `@description` now work correctly

* `@useDynLib` now works correctly:

       @useDynLib packageName routine1 routine2

   produces

       useDynLib(packageName, routine1)
       useDynLib(packageName, routine2)

   in the NAMESPACE file, instead of separate (wrong) useDynLib statements as
   before.

* All namespace import directives now behave in the same way as the export
  directives, producing multiple single directives instead one multiple
  directive: `@importClassesFrom pkg a b` now produces
  `importClassesFrom(pkg, a)` and `importClassesFrom(pkg, b)`

* In example files included with `@example` you can now use infix operators
  (e.g. %*%) or other things with %, because they will be preceded by a
  backslash in the Rd file. This behaviour was already in place for examples
  directly included with `@examples`.

* Aliases are no longer quoted, and % is escaped with a backslash (Fixes #24).
  Names also have % escaped (Fixes #50)

* Replacement functions (e.g. `foo<-`) now get correct usage statements:
  `foo() <- value` instead of `foo()<-value`. (Fixes #38)

* Functions with no arguments now correctly get usage statements (Fixes #35)

* Indentation in examples now preserved (Fixes #27)

* roxygen2 will replace characters that are not valid in filenames with a
  character substitute, e.g. `[]` becomes `sub`, `<-` becomes `set` (Fixes #6)

* Usage strings use non-breaking spaces to prevent string default values
  containing whitespace to be split across multiple lines. This may cause
  problems in the unlikely event that you have default value containing a
  non-breaking space (`"\uA0"')  (Fixes #21)

* Functions with quoted names now get correct usage statements (Fixes #41)

* Objects that no longer exist are not documented (Fixes #42)

* Errors now display file name and line number of roxygen block to help you
  find the problem. Thanks to code contributions from Renaud Gaujoux.
  (Fixes #13)

* Documentation with no untagged text but with `@title`, `@description` and
  `@details` tags now produces correct output.

# roxygen2 2.1

* `Collate` field in `DESCRIPTION` no longer needs to exist

* `=` now recognised as way of assigning functions

* `x$y <- function() {...}` no longer causes error

* A special thanks goes to Yihui Xie who contributed all of the fixes and
  improvements (bar one) in this version!

# roxygen2 2.0

## Major changes

* now works with run-time details to give more accurate output. This requires
  that the source code that roxygen is documenting be loaded prior to
  documentation. roxygen will attempt to do so, but you need to ensure
  required packages are loaded.

    Run-time data fixes some long standing bugs where roxygen couldn't correctly
    figure out function usage. We are not aware of any cases where you still
    need to use the `@usage` tag.

* written in idiomatic R, and uses S3 instead of a homegrown class system.

* roclets build up an internal data structure instead of writing to disk
  directly. This means that you can now use the `@rdname` tag to merge
  documentation for multiple functions into one file, and that only unique
  namespace directives are written to `NAMESPACE` (which makes `@importFrom`
  much more useful).

* some features have been removed, and may or may not (based on your feedback)
  be reincluded. These include the callgraph roclet, and `R CMD roxygen`,
  which only worked on some systems.

* a templating system: use the `@template` tag to insert a `brew` template
  stored in `man-roxygen`. Template variables can be set using `@templateVar
  name value` and retrieved from within the template with `<%= name %>`

* extensive use of caching to make repeated runs as fast as possible. To clear
  caches and guarantee a complete rebuild, use `clear_caches()`.

* parsing of "introduction" (the text before the first tag) has changed. Now
  the title consists of the first paragraph (i.e. all text before the first
  empty line), the second paragraph is the description and all others are put
  in the details. Any component can be overridden with `@title`,
  `@description` and `@details` as appropriate.

## Minor changes

* `@name` is always output as an alias, even if `@aliases` are used.

* `@export` correctly uses `@method` to generate `S3method` namespace
  directive

## New tags

* `@rdname filename` sets the output filename (without extension). Use for
  functions non-alphanumeric functions (e.g. `[<-`) or if you want to document
  multiple functions in one file

* `@template templatename` includes a documentation template (see above)

* `@section Section title: contents` includes a section with any title. Don't
  forget the colon! That separates the title of the section from its contents.

* `@description` and `@details` tags allow you to specify description and
  details components in a template

* `@family family name` automatically adds see-also cross-references between
  all functions in a family. A function can belong to multiple families.

* `@inheritParams name` allows you to inherit the documentation for parameters
  from another function, either within the current package (`function`) or in
  any other installed package (`package:function`). Currently only supports
  single inheritance (i.e. you can't inherit from a function that inherits
  from another function), but you can have multiple @inheritParams tags.

* `@format` has been implemented; it existed in the roxygen package but was
  actually ignored
